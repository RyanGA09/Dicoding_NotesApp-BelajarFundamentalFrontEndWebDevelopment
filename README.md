## Description

Dicoding NotesApp is a simple note-taking application built to fulfill the submissions for the **Learn FrontEnd Web Development Fundamentals** course on Dicoding. This app aims to help users create and manage notes effectively.

### Submission 1: Building the Notes App

In this submission, the NotesApp was developed with the following basic features:

- Create new notes.
- View the list of existing notes.
- Delete & edit notes from the list.
- Notes data is fetched from a JSON file using the **fetch API**.
- Utilizes **Custom Elements** to build reusable components.

### Submission 2: Integrating the Notes App with a RESTful API

In the second submission, the NotesApp has been enhanced to integrate with a RESTful API provided by Dicoding. The app now includes the following advanced features:

- Fetch notes from a RESTful API: Notes data is now fetched from the Dicoding Notes API [https://notes-api.dicoding.dev/v2/notes](https://notes-api.dicoding.dev/v2/notes).
- Archive and Unarchive notes: Users can archive or unarchive notes, which moves them between the "Archived Notes" and "Active Notes" sections.
- Real-time updates: The app dynamically updates the UI when notes are added, deleted, archived, or unarchived.
- Loading indicators: A loading indicator is displayed while fetching data or performing actions like adding, deleting, or archiving notes.
- Error handling: The app provides user-friendly error messages when API requests fail.
- Custom Events: The app uses Custom Events to handle actions like adding, deleting, archiving, and unarchiving notes, ensuring a decoupled and modular architecture.

#### Key Features in Submission 2
